Docker Desktop allows you to create and test Arm images from your Windows desktop.\n",

    "The best way to create images for Arm is to use the new buildx command which is included in Docker Desktop. The command usage is shown in this code:\n",

    "Create a new builder instance and use it, then build three images which are stored locally, this can be seen in the following code:\n",

    "Now the images for each architecture are on this local machine. However, the goal is to save a single image that works on all platforms. This can be done with a single buildx command which pushes directly to a repository like Docker Hub. Using a repository is an easy way to migrate images to other machines, because the images can be pulled directly from the repository using any machine.\n",
